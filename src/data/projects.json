        "description": "Web-based scavenger hunt experience. I designed five medallions — Anime, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Gaming, and the ultimate gold medallion. (Note: the Gaming medallion design was changed last minute due to Nintendo IP concerns, so my version was not used.) I also created the postcard and event signage, and the ultimate medallion was produced as a physical souvenir for guests who completed the quest.",
